<h5> Personal Statement <br><br> My natural curiosity for making has shaped a distinctive creative handwriting rooted in hands-on experimentation, material exploration, and learning through doing. From drawing on the living room walls as a child to producing FIDA- and GFW-shortlisted illustrations, accessories, and collaborative photoshoots for my Final Major Project, my work has always been driven by authentic intention and a desire to understand materials through direct engagement. <br><br>With a exploratory approach, I have consistently sought opportunities to learn from different craftspeople, environments, and processes. Early experiences included spending hours learning ceramics with my mother and developing film in the school darkroom (cupboard). This instinct followed me into my degree, where I worked in every workshop I could persuade the technicians to let me use, motivated by a belief that technical understanding comes most fully through making rather than theory alone. <br><br>At university, I shaped my fashion practice into a framework for technical learning. I designed garments specifically to enable screen printing and natural dyeing, created a self- directed accessories brief to develop skills in metalwork and welding in the 3D workshop, and produced labels to learn how to use laser cutter. I actively sought opportunities beyond the fashion studio, and my workspace became a place of tranquillity — one of focus, experimentation, and quiet productivity. I graduated with a First-Class degree in Fashion, supported by a practice grounded equally in creativity, craft, and discipline.<br><br>Alongside my studies, professional experience has reinforced my confidence as a practical, reliable maker who thrives in active, real-world environments. For the past five years between September and November, I have worked as the in-house sign maker and designer for Kendal Mountain Festival, operating as part of the wider events team during both the main festival and touring events. I worked independently under tight deadlines, producing large-scale signage and fabric banners using reclaimed materials and responding quickly to changing priorities in high-pressure, time-dependent circumstances. I also designed merchandise including stickers, sew-on patches, and buffs, generating strong sales and ongoing demand. This long-term commitment reflects my reliability, physical stamina, and ability to meet the increasing demands of a growing festival year on year. <br><br>I am confident with manual handling and practical setup tasks, with extensive experience in workshop and production environments requiring safe working practices, precision, and physical work. From February to September 2025, I worked as a workshop assistant for a LED sign maker, soldering and producing vinyl stickers. Additional experience assisting in ceramic studios including Rebecca Callis Porcelain and Studio 573 has strengthened my attention to detail, accuracy, and respect for a wide range of creative processes. <br><br> My work communicates emotionally, forming honest and sometimes unexpected connections between disparate subjects. I value interpretation and invite audiences to engage with my work on their own terms, even when this differs from my original intention. Making is both expressive and reflective for me — a way of communicating without words. Through materials, form, and process, I articulate ideas with clarity, care, and emotional depth, while bringing energy, practicality, and commitment to every team and environment I work within.</h5>
